# ***So how is this different from all the other DRG save transfer programs?*** #
I'm glad you asked.

Firstly, *Molly's Game-Save Mule* is clearly the prettiest.

Secondly, other programs might determine the file with the most progress, but they only consider the most recent file write.

This can be a problem!

### Picture this... ###
Imagine you have 200 hours of progress on Steam and you want to play with friends on Xbox.

So you install the Gamepass version of DRG and load it up to make sure it works.

But now, your empty xbox save file now has the most recent changes.

A program that only considers most recent file write will replace your 200-hour Steam save with your empty Xbox save!

### So we punched the guy in R&D until he agreed to come up with a solution.
